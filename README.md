How I prepared for Kubernetes CKA and CKAD Certification Exams

## Books

[Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes by John Arundel and Justin Domingus](https://www.amazon.in/Cloud-Native-DevOps-Kubernetes-Arundel/dp/1492040762/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3JJ9LAE2E6L4W&keywords=cloud+native+devops+with+kubernetes&qid=1581853061&sprefix=cloud+native+dev%2Caps%2C280&sr=8-2) This is the best book that I have read in a recent time. It's well written and covers I think all of the Kubernetes in Production environment concepts really well. You will also see a list of tools from the Kubernetes Landscape with right examples. 

[Kubernetes Patterns by Bilgin Ibryam & Roland Hub](https://www.amazon.in/Kubernetes-Patterns-Bilgin-Ibryam/dp/1492050288/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1UW6WTYF33K2&keywords=kubernetes+patterns&qid=1581853405&sprefix=kubernetes+patt%2Caps%2C262&sr=8-1) Going throguh this book was my personal choice, rather than a suggestion. I have built softwares that run on Blade Servers, Colo clouds, virtual machines, and even with Serverless. Understanding the patterns is a important aspect as it will help me design better systems with Kubernetes instead of just rolling out containers. 

[Kubernetes Up and Running by Brendan Burns, Kelsey Hightower, Joe Beda](https://www.amazon.in/Kubernetes-Running-Future-Infrastructure-Second/dp/935213916X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3J5CNJZIT350&keywords=kubernetes+up+and+running&qid=1581853574&sprefix=kubernetes+up%2Caps%2C274&sr=8-1) This one was an easy choice, Brendan Burns and Joe Beda are the co-creators of Kubernetes, nothing more to explain here. It's very unlikely that if you are working around Kubernetes and you have not come across a talk or a blog post of Kelsey Hightower.
